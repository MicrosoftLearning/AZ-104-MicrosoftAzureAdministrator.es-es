# Purpose

This directory provides instructor demonstrations for the AZ-104 Azure Administrator course. **It is not intended for you to do every demonstration. Pick the ones most applicable to your audience.**

# Things to think about

- Most areas have a demonstration. Take the time to work through each one and decide which to use. Some of the demonstrations are simple show and tell walk-throughs of the Azure portal; others require scripting skills.

- Consider having the students follow along as you do the demonstration or have one of the students' "drive" and coach them through the steps.

- Consider doing the demonstration first and then using the slides to answer questions and ensure everything is covered.

- Consider the overlap with the formal labs and make the best use of your time.

- These demonstrations are provided for an instructor with Azure administration experience. The steps are at a higher level than the course labs that students will perform.

- These demonstrations provide a minimal set of features to show your students. As time permits feel free to add, show, and discuss more things.

- The *Summary and Resources* page identifies where Learn sandboxes are available. Consider using a sandbox to walk students through the steps.

- If you don't have a demonstration environment consider using the Tutorial and QuickStart pages that are provided.
